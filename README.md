# Notes on Development. 

**This App is mostly untested on apple devices. For best results, please use an android device.** 

The Expo publish links can be found here:

This should also run fine locally with the following configurations:

* node: v18.14.2
* npm: v9.5.0

1. Run npx expo install
2. npm start
3. Scan the QR code (preferably on an android device). 


As a final option there is an apk file that is installable on android devices. There may be some permissions you will need to bypass on your device as the app is from an untrusted source.

This has been included in the zip file and can also be downloaded from:
